# PROJECT OBJECTIVES :
**By the end of this project you will**

âž¼ Know fundamental concepts and techniques of Convolutional Neural Network.

âž¼ Gain a broad understanding of image data.

âž¼ Know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data preprocessing techniques.

âž¼ Know how to build a web application using Flask framework.

# PROJECT FLOW :

â¦¿ User interacts with the UI (User Interface) to upload the image as input

â¦¿ Depending on the different gesture inputs different operations are applied to the input image.

â¦¿ Once model analyses the gesture, the prediction with operation applied on image is showcased on the UI.

**To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below**

âž¼ Data Collection.

    â¦¿ Collect the dataset or Create the dataset

âž¼ Data Preprocessing.

    â¦¿ Import the ImageDataGenerator library
    â¦¿ Configure ImageDataGenerator class
    â¦¿ Apply ImageDataGenerator functionality to Trainset and Testset

âž¼ Model Building

    â¦¿ Import the model building Libraries
    â¦¿ Initializing the model
    â¦¿ Adding Input Layer\
    â¦¿ Adding Hidden Layer
    â¦¿ Adding Output Layer
    â¦¿ Configure the Learning Process
    â¦¿ Training and testing the model
    â¦¿ Save the Model

âž¼ Application Building

    â¦¿ Create an HTML file
    â¦¿ Build Python Code

â¦¿ Dataset folder contains the training and testing images for training our model.

â¦¿ We are building a Flask Application which needs  HTML pages stored in the templates 
   folder and a python script app.py for server side scripting

â¦¿ we need the model which is saved and the saved model in this content is gesture.h5

â¦¿ The static folder will contain js and css files.

â¦¿ Whenever we upload a image to predict, that images is saved in uploads folder.
